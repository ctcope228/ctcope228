Hi,

My name is Caleb Cope. I'm a motivated computer engineering student at The Ohio State University seeking employment for summer 2025 to apply my technical skills and contribute to innovative projects. My background includes: programming in Java, C++, and C#, web development in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and real-time graphical development in Unity (C#), and Unreal (C++). Feel free to browse my page to see what I've been working on, and check out the Collaborative Software Development Club at OSU to see some group projects I've worked on.
